# bankingApp
**Created by Ethan Jones**

This command-line banking application written in Java is meant to demonstrate some of the skills I learned during my first year as a computer science major.

This project implements some of the following things I learned:
* Object-Oriented Programming in Java
* Data Structures (ArrayLists and LinkedLists)
* Serialization and Deserialization
* Exception Handling
* Conditional logic and control flow
